# New Generation Academy Website Documentation

## Project Overview

The New Generation Academy website is a comprehensive web application designed to serve as the online presence for the academy. The project is divided into two main components: a frontend client and a backend API server.

### Architecture Components

1. **Frontend (Client)** - Built with HTML, TailwindCSS, PHP (for routing via .htaccess), AnimateCSS, and Axios for API requests
2. **Backend** - Developed using Node.js with TypeScript, MySQL database, and Express.js framework

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, PHP, AnimateCSS, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, MySQL
- **Development Tools**: VS Code, Git, MAMP (for local development)

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation (Week 1-2)

- [ ] Set up development environment (MAMP, Node.js, VS Code)
- [ ] Initialize Git repository and establish branching strategy
- [ ] Create basic project structure (client/, backend/, documentation)
- [ ] Configure environment variables (.env file)
- [ ] Set up package.json and basic dependencies for backend
- [ ] Create initial HTML structure and CSS framework integration

### Phase 2: Backend Development (Week 3-6)

- [ ] Design and implement database schema (MySQL)
- [ ] Set up Express.js server with TypeScript
- [ ] Implement authentication system (login/register)
- [ ] Create API endpoints for contact forms
- [ ] Add input validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement middleware for CORS, logging, and security
- [ ] Set up database connection and migrations
- [ ] Write unit tests for API endpoints

### Phase 3: Frontend Development (Week 7-10)

- [ ] Implement PHP routing system with .htaccess
- [ ] Create responsive navigation and footer components
- [ ] Develop homepage with dynamic content loading
- [ ] Implement contact form with JavaScript validation
- [ ] Integrate Axios for API communication
- [ ] Add animations and interactive elements with AnimateCSS
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness across all pages
- [ ] Implement error handling and user feedback

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Week 11-12)

- [ ] Connect frontend to backend APIs
- [ ] Test end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Implement form submissions and data persistence
- [ ] Add loading states and user feedback
- [ ] Perform cross-browser testing
- [ ] Optimize performance and load times
- [ ] Security testing and vulnerability assessment

### Phase 5: Deployment and Launch (Week 13)

- [ ] Set up production environment
- [ ] Configure domain and hosting
- [ ] Deploy backend to production server
- [ ] Deploy frontend files to web server
- [ ] Test production environment
- [ ] Set up monitoring and error tracking
- [ ] Launch website and monitor initial usage

### Phase 6: Maintenance and Future Enhancements (Ongoing)

- [ ] Monitor website performance and user feedback
- [ ] Plan for additional features (user dashboard, course management, etc.)
- [ ] Regular security updates and patches
- [ ] Content updates and maintenance
- [ ] Scale infrastructure as needed

## Development Guidelines

- Follow consistent coding standards and naming conventions
- Use Git for version control with descriptive commit messages
- Document all code changes and new features
- Test thoroughly before deploying to production
- Maintain security best practices throughout development

## Risk Management

- Identify potential bottlenecks in development timeline
- Have backup plans for technology stack changes
- Regular code reviews to maintain quality
- Contingency plans for server downtime or data loss

## Success Metrics

- Website loads within 3 seconds
- Mobile responsive design works on all devices
- Contact forms submit successfully
- Secure authentication system
- Clean, professional design matching academy branding
